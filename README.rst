Magical Compressed sensing
==========================

A small example game to demonstrate the power of compressed sensing, written in python.

Usage
-----

execute the python script, it will tell you what to do

Dependencies
------------

Requires Numpy and cvxopt.

Background
----------

Compressed sensing is a powerful technique to recover a signal from a small
number of measurements, if it is known that the signal has a sparse
representation.

For more information about compressed sensing see the `blog post <http://pseudotron.ist-dein-freund.de/sparsity-and-compressed-sensing.html>`_ or `this site with lots of information. <https://sites.google.com/site/igorcarron2/cs>`_
